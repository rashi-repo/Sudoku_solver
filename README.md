# Sudoku_solver
This Python script allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle through the command line and solves it using a backtracking algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter each row of the puzzle, using 0 to represent empty cells. It validates the input to ensure that each row contains exactly nine numbers (ranging from 0 to 9).
